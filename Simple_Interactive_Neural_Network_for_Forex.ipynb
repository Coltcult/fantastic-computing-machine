        "    Forex Neural Network User Guide and Instructions:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1.  Purpose:\n",
        "        This Python script implements a simple neural network designed to analyze Forex (foreign exchange) market data.  It's intended to help you explore how neural networks can be used to predict future price movements (whether a currency pair's price will go up or down).  **It is crucial to understand that this is a simplified example for educational purposes.** It is NOT intended for use in real-world trading without extensive modification, testing, and a thorough understanding of the risks involved.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2.  Disclaimer:\n",
        "        -   **This is NOT a trading system.** The script provides a basic framework for analysis.  It does not guarantee profits, and you could lose money if you use it for actual trading.\n",
        "        -   **Forex trading is risky.** You can lose money rapidly due to factors like market volatility, leverage, and unforeseen economic events.\n",
        "        -   **Use at your own risk.** The author of this code is not responsible for any financial losses you may incur.  You should consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any trading decisions.\n",
        "        -   **This code is for educational purposes only.** Experiment with it, learn from it, but do not rely on it for real-world trading.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3.  How This Code Can Be Useful (in an educational context):\n",
        "        -   **Understanding Neural Networks:** The script demonstrates how a basic neural network is structured and trained.  You can see how data is loaded, preprocessed, fed into the network, and used to make predictions.\n",
        "        -   **Exploring Forex Data:** You can use this script to analyze historical Forex data, identify patterns, and see how different features (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) relate to price movements.\n",
        "        -   **Experimenting with Parameters:** The script allows you to experiment with various parameters, such as the number of neurons, dropout rate, training epochs, and optimizer.  You can observe how these parameters affect the model's performance.\n",
        "        -   **Learning about Machine Learning for Finance:** This script provides a starting point for learning how machine learning techniques can be applied to financial data.  It can help you understand the challenges and limitations of using machine learning in this domain.\n",

        "    7.  Data Preparation:\n",
        "        -   **Data Source:** You will need historical Forex data in CSV format.  Reliable sources include Dukascopy, TrueFX, and your broker (if they provide historical data).\n",
        "        -   **Data Format:** The CSV file should contain columns for:\n",
        "            -   `Date` or `Time`:  The date and time of each data point.  The code will automatically detect either 'Date' or 'Time'.\n",
        "            -   `Open`:  The opening price for the period.\n",
        "            -   `High`:  The highest price for the period.\n",
        "            -   `Low`:  The lowest price for the period.\n",
        "            -   `Close`:  The closing price for the period.\n",
        "            -   `Volume`:  The trading volume for the period.\n",
        "        -   **Data Cleaning:** Ensure your data is relatively clean (missing values handled, consistent formatting).  The script does some basic cleaning (dropping rows with missing values), but you may need to do more preprocessing depending on your data source.\n",
        "        -    **Timeframe:** The data should be in a consistent timeframe (e.g., 1-hour, 1-day, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "    8.  How to Use the Code:\n",
        "        -   Run the script.\n",
        "        -   The script will prompt you to enter the following:\n",
        "            -   **CSV File Path:** Enter the path to your Forex CSV data file (e.g., `EURUSD_data.csv`).\n",
        "            -   **Currency Pair:** Enter the currency pair you are analyzing (e.g., `EURUSD`, `GBPUSD`, `USDJPY`).  This is used for naming the saved model.\n",
        "            -   **Use a validation set?:** Enter 'yes' to split the training data into training and validation sets. This is recommended for better model training.\n",
        "            -   **Normalize the data?:** Enter 'yes' to normalize the input data.  This is generally recommended for neural networks.\n",
        "            -   **Number of Neurons:** Enter the number of neurons in the hidden layers of the neural network (e.g., 64, 128, 256).  More neurons can capture more complex patterns but may also lead to overfitting.\n",
        "            -   **Dropout Rate:** Enter the dropout rate (e.g., 0.2, 0.3, 0.5).  Dropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting.  A common range is 0.1 to 0.5.\n",
        "            -   **Optimizer:** Choose an optimization algorithm for training the neural network ('adam', 'sgd', or 'rmsprop').  Adam is often a good default choice.\n",
        "            -   **Number of Epochs:** Enter the number of training epochs (e.g., 100, 200, 500).  An epoch is one complete pass through the training data.\n",
        "            -   **Batch Size:** Enter the batch size (e.g., 32, 64, 128).  The number of data points processed before the model's weights are updated.\n",
        "            -   **Use early stopping?:** Enter 'yes' to use early stopping.  This will stop the training process if the model's performance on the validation set stops improving, preventing overfitting.\n",
        "            -   **Early stopping patience:** Enter the number of epochs to wait for improvement in validation loss before stopping.\n",
        "            -   **Verbosity level:** 0, 1, or 2.  0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = one line per epoch.\n",
        "            -   **Save the trained model?:** Enter 'yes' to save the trained neural network model to a file.  This allows you to load and reuse the model later without retraining.\n",
        "            -   **Load the saved model for prediction?:** If you saved a model, you can choose to load it and make a prediction on some data\n",
        "            -   **Number of future predictions?:** Enter how many future predictions you want to make\n",
        "        -   The script will then:\n",
        "            -   Load and preprocess the data from your CSV file.\n",
        "            -   Create and train the neural network model.\n",
        "            -   Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.\n",

        "            -   Save the trained model (if you choose to).\n",
        "            -   Make predictions (if you choose to).\n",
        "\n",
        "    9.  Understanding the Output:\n",
        "        -   **Test Accuracy:** This is the percentage of times the model correctly\n",
        "Okay, I've added detailed instructions and a user guide directly into the code as comments. This should provide comprehensive guidance on how to use the script and clarify its purpose for forex trading analysis."

        "\n",
        "    1.  Purpose:\n",
        "        This Python script implements a simple neural network designed to analyze Forex (foreign exchange) market data.  It's intended to help you explore how neural networks can be used to predict future price movements (whether a currency pair's price will go up or down).  **It is crucial to understand that this is a simplified example for educational purposes.** It is NOT intended for use in real-world trading without extensive modification, testing, and a thorough understanding of the risks involved.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2.  Disclaimer:\n",
        "        -   **This is NOT a trading system.** The script provides a basic framework for analysis.  It does not guarantee profits, and you could lose money if you use it for actual trading.\n",
        "        -   **Forex trading is risky.** You can lose money rapidly due to factors like market volatility, leverage, and unforeseen economic events.\n",
        "        -   **Use at your own risk.** The author of this code is not responsible for any financial losses you may incur.  You should consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any trading decisions.\n",
        "        -   **This code is for educational purposes only.** Experiment with it, learn from it, but do not rely on it for real-world trading.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3.  How This Code Can Be Useful (in an educational context):\n",
        "        -   **Understanding Neural Networks:** The script demonstrates how a basic neural network is structured and trained.  You can see how data is loaded, preprocessed, fed into the network, and used to make predictions.\n",
        "        -   **Exploring Forex Data:** You can use this script to analyze historical Forex data, identify patterns, and see how different features (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) relate to price movements.\n",
        "        -   **Experimenting with Parameters:** The script allows you to experiment with various parameters, such as the number of neurons, dropout rate, training epochs, and optimizer.  You can observe how these parameters affect the model's performance.\n",
        "        -   **Learning about Machine Learning for Finance:** This script provides a starting point for learning how machine learning techniques can be applied to financial data.  It can help you understand the challenges and limitations of using machine learning in this domain.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "    7.  Data Preparation:\n",
        "        -   **Data Source:** You will need historical Forex data in CSV format.  Reliable sources include Dukascopy, TrueFX, and your broker (if they provide historical data).\n",
        "        -   **Data Format:** The CSV file should contain columns for:\n",
        "            -   `Date` or `Time`:  The date and time of each data point.  The code will automatically detect either 'Date' or 'Time'.\n",
        "            -   `Open`:  The opening price for the period.\n",
        "            -   `High`:  The highest price for the period.\n",
        "            -   `Low`:  The lowest price for the period.\n",
        "            -   `Close`:  The closing price for the period.\n",
        "            -   `Volume`:  The trading volume for the period.\n",
        "        -   **Data Cleaning:** Ensure your data is relatively clean (missing values handled, consistent formatting).  The script does some basic cleaning (dropping rows with missing values), but you may need to do more preprocessing depending on your data source.\n",
        "        -    **Timeframe:** The data should be in a consistent timeframe (e.g., 1-hour, 1-day, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "    8.  How to Use the Code:\n",
        "        -   Run the script.\n",
        "        -   The script will prompt you to enter the following:\n",
        "            -   **CSV File Path:** Enter the path to your Forex CSV data file (e.g., `EURUSD_data.csv`).\n",
        "            -   **Currency Pair:** Enter the currency pair you are analyzing (e.g., `EURUSD`, `GBPUSD`, `USDJPY`).  This is used for naming the saved model.\n",
        "            -   **Use a validation set?:** Enter 'yes' to split the training data into training and validation sets. This is recommended for better model training.\n",
        "            -   **Normalize the data?:** Enter 'yes' to normalize the input data.  This is generally recommended for neural networks.\n",
        "            -   **Number of Neurons:** Enter the number of neurons in the hidden layers of the neural network (e.g., 64, 128, 256).  More neurons can capture more complex patterns but may also lead to overfitting.\n",
        "            -   **Dropout Rate:** Enter the dropout rate (e.g., 0.2, 0.3, 0.5).  Dropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting.  A common range is 0.1 to 0.5.\n",
        "            -   **Optimizer:** Choose an optimization algorithm for training the neural network ('adam', 'sgd', or 'rmsprop').  Adam is often a good default choice.\n",
        "            -   **Number of Epochs:** Enter the number of training epochs (e.g., 100, 200, 500).  An epoch is one complete pass through the training data.\n",
        "            -   **Batch Size:** Enter the batch size (e.g., 32, 64, 128).  The number of data points processed before the model's weights are updated.\n",
        "            -   **Use early stopping?:** Enter 'yes' to use early stopping.  This will stop the training process if the model's performance on the validation set stops improving, preventing overfitting.\n",
        "            -   **Early stopping patience:** Enter the number of epochs to wait for improvement in validation loss before stopping.\n",
        "            -   **Verbosity level:** 0, 1, or 2.  0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = one line per epoch.\n",
        "            -   **Save the trained model?:** Enter 'yes' to save the trained neural network model to a file.  This allows you to load and reuse the model later without retraining.\n",
        "            -   **Load the saved model for prediction?:** If you saved a model, you can choose to load it and make a prediction on some data\n",
        "            -   **Number of future predictions?:** Enter how many future predictions you want to make\n",
        "        -   The script will then:\n",
        "            -   Load and preprocess the data from your CSV file.\n",
        "            -   Create and train the neural network model.\n",
        "            -   Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.\n",
